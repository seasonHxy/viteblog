## Self-Introduce
::: info

I am graduated from Dongguang University with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer science and technology. during the winter in 2017,i had a frontend developer at Financial Institutions, I really enjoyed what i did.

I really like digging into new technology,because it helps me learn, especically web applications.

I remember during my career,one of my team leader asked to do a research learning on Progressive Development Framework. I spent a whole week doing collect and making study plans. I found the whole process really fulfilling. It made me enjoy being a front end developer.

Thus,I had love the chance to lean more about web application teahnology like javascript about node.js react and webpack,which is why I'm so excited about this opportunity in your company.

I'm hoping to gain more knowledge on front end and rear end and to become a fullstack developer in the near future.
