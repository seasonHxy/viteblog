Do you work well under pressure?

well,it seems that you check all the boxes, just one question, do you work well under pressure?
I think that I work really well under pressuer, In the High stree environment especically .
Do you work well under pressure? This gotta be one of the most uncomfortable interview question there is.
Because it is a very tricky one. There's so many job applicants that they make a huge mistake,when they are relying to thie question.So it is a very tricky one.So think about why the supervisor, the manager, why are they asking you this question? they are assessing your decision making skill, your problem solving sking, and how quickly you can think on your feet.
But more importantly,they want to konw are you a snowflake? Are you gonna melt under pressure? Are you gonna crack?
Or are you gonna collapse when things get tough? Can they count on you when things get tough?
That's actually what they are asking.So here's what you don't want to say.
See, if you say no, obviously that's a bad answer.But if you just say yes, that's also a bad answer.
you don't just want to say yes, cause the it come across. well, everybody says yes, how do i konw you're not telling a lie?
And you don't want to exaggerate either, So instead what you want to do, is you want to tell a story.
And you should rehearse, and have prepared this story ahead of the time. So instead of just saying yes,So yes, I work well under pressure. Well, how do i know? right? they don't konw. As far as they're concerned, you could be lying right?
Instead you tell a story.It could be a simple story like this.

I remember when I was in yonyou financial,I was actually being put into a group of four. And four of us, me and three other one junior and two middle, woring on a project. And we divided our responsibilities. And we had one month working on this particular project.
And I was doing my part and they were doing their part. And we had to get together everyDay, And I was sharing with them what I have done for.And two of them, actually,didn't complete what they were supposed to do. I was a little bit disappointed,
but konwing that we actually didn't have a lot of time.So I had to, yes, burn some midnight oil and kind of work on their part and finish what they were supposed to be their responsibilities.But I did it.And the I actually had to be the one that make the presentation, and at the end, I got a A for that particular project.

You see the difference?  You are actually sharing a story of how you have dealt with pressure. How do you operate under pressure?
That's what they want to work. So it could be someting that you've doing college. it could be someting that you've done in sport right?
If you actually play any kind of sports or you compete, or it could be simething that from your previous job, that you have to make a presentation.or there's a very tight deadling, or you work with other people .What have you done ? Right?Share that story. 
Remember, facts tell but stories sell. You wanna have some of those stories, in your kind of back pocket.
So whenever you need it, you can just do it. And within a stroy you wanna hit a few key point:
NO1: how you have used your skils to handle the situation.
NO2: How you are taking responsibilities, and that you're not blaming, right? You're not playing victims.That's good to know for the supervisor, for the HR person.That's very powerful to know, right ?
No3: you kind of also wanna share what are the result right? What happens?So you did this and this how you handle it, and here is the outcome. So now they can see the full journey.So, don't just answer yes or no.Prepare a couple of these stories.
And by the way, don't exaggerate.Don't say,"Oh I nerver fell stressed, it is nerver a problem. I can handle any situation.I work very well under pressure.",No that is very bad answer,It is much better to do that through storytelling.
One more tip that I want to give you is when you finish that story, you could also share what are some of things that you do to relieve stree.Because it's good to konw, then they konw that your're kind of working on this and you have an outlet. Example, it is good for them to know, because then they konw that you kind of have an outlet. Maybe you will say, 
You konw What, whenever I feel stressed, I would go for a run or I would do yoga or I meditate daily. Or whatever it is that you do.
Share that.Because then they konw, that you're not just the kind of person, that would balled up all your emotions. 
and take out all the pressure, and then you're gonna explode some day.
I have a hobby that when I do that, it release my stress. So they know, Ok, you are a healthy person mentally.
So the key to handle this question, do you work well under pressure? Is to have a well-crafted, well-rehearsed story that you could share.
